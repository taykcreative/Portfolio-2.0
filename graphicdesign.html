                            <h4>Fresca Advertising Poster</h4>
                    
                            <p>I created this Fresca advertisement poster only using <span class="emphasis">Adobe PhotoShop</span>. My intended audience is all genders ages fourteen and up as they can most likely purchase their own beverages. I wanted to show what the drink tastes like since the can only states: “Original Citrus” which isn’t too clear. There are multiple citrus fruits all with different taste. Fresca Original Citrus happens to be grapefruit flavored.</p>

                            <p>I chose a very simple design. When a person thinks of the word “refreshing”, what do they think of first? Water! So I chose to place the Fresca can above a body of water with ripples. I wanted the Fresca to look like it came out of the water. The grapefruits were added to show the flavor of “Original Citrus”. It was difficult for me to find a coordinating color for the text, so I actually took the yellow banner from the Fresca can, removed the words, flipped the can upside down, and then created a clipping mask over the text.</p>

                            <p>I like to code web-pages myself, but <a href="https://diddlyglutenfreemix.com/">this client's website</a> was made with Wix &#40;hence why it's not in the Web Development section of my portfolio&#41;. This particular client has a fully functional Wix site that hasn't expired yet so to save them money, I decided to stick with Wix until their renewal.</p>
                                
                            <p>When the client is due to renew, I plan to switch them to <span class="emphasis">Shopify</span>.</p>

                            <h4>Pierson's Florist Marketing Tabloid</h4>

                            <p>I created an event poster advertising a Floral Arrangement class for Pierson’s Florist. This poster was created with <span class="emphasis">Adobe Illustrator</span>. My intended audience is anybody that is interested in flowers or gardening. This tabloid is designed to appeal to a more feminine audience.</p>
                                
                            <p>My goal was to advertise an event, but also show what the event is about at a distance. I think I achieved my goal with the use of flowers as the main image. I used a radial gradient and a drop shadow to add some depth to the flowers to make them really stand out.</p>
